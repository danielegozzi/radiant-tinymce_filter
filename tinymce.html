<p>TinyMCE allows you to enter text into Radiant using a basic WYSIWYG view (What You See Is What You Get) much like you would find in Microsoft Word or other word processing software. To start writing, simply click in the white area underneath the toolbar and start typing.</p>

<p>Like Microsoft Word and many other word processors, special functions are accessed by using the toolbar. To find out the purpose of an icon in the TinyMCE toolbar, simply hover your mouse over that icon and a small tool-tip will appear explaining it's basic function.</p>

<div class="important">
<h3>Writing for the web</h3>

<p>Writing for the web is a little different than writing using a regular word processor. In a traditional word document, every word, no matter how big or small, is really just text dressed up a little differently. Text on web pages is a bit different than that because all text on the page actually has an underlying "meaning" to it. That meaning must be addressed if your web page is to look and behave as it should.</p>

<p>To put it another way &#8230; in a word document, you might know that a heading is a heading because it is larger than the surrounding text and it is a different color. That is, it <strong>means</strong> something different from regular text because it <strong>looks</strong> different (meaning is inferred from appearance).</p>

<p>In a web page, a heading must actually be <em>designated</em> as a heading element, and once designated thusly, that text automatically takes on the size and coloring inherent to a heading element. That is, it <strong>looks</strong> different from regular text because it <strong>actually is different</strong> (appearance is inferred from meaning).</p>

<p>So what does all this mean for you? When you are creating and editing pages make sure that if a section of text is supposed to be a paragraph that you actually format the section as a paragraph. The same thing goes for heading on a page, etc. Formatting text is easy &#8230; simply highlight the text you want to change and select a "Format" or "Style" to apply to it.</p>

<p>You will find "generic" text types under the "Format" menu. These text types correspond to the basic types of text &#8230; paragraphs, headings, etc.</p>

<p>You will find "special-case" text types under the "Styles" menu. These special cases are used to modify the basic values of text found under the "Format" menu. These styles are typically set by your web designer so as to maintain a consistent look and feel across your website.</p>

<p>While writing this way can take some getting used to, it really is a much better way to think about writing. After all, it's not just people with good vision sitting in front of a desktop computer that access your website. People with physical disabilities (blindness), people browsing using their cell phones, and even search engines all expect that different "types" of text are actually marked up as being different. For these users, how a thing "looks" is completely meaningless. The only way to ensure that these users can properly understand the meaning of your text no matter what kind of browser they are using is by formatting special types of text using the "Format" and "Styles" toolbar functions.</p>

<p>There are a number of specialized buttons within TinyMCE that you will not see in a regular word processor. Some of the more unusual/powerful of these are explained below.</p>

<h3>The HTML Button</h3>
<img src="/images/extensions/tiny_mce/html-button.gif" width="41" height="44" alt="" class="border align-left" />
<p>If you ever need to manipulate the source code of a section by hand, click on this button to open a new window populated with the raw HTML of the page. <strong>Do not make changes this way unless you know what you are doing.</strong></p>
 

Editor Tips
Sometimes you may see a large yellow exclamation point in the editor window.ï¿¼This yellow exclamation point is there to tell you that a section of special CMS code (a snippet) is needed on this page to make the page work properly. You should never delete or modify this code (or the accompanying icon) from a page unless you know what you are doing!
